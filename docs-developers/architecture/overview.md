# Architecture Overview

This section provides detailed technical documentation about Synstream's architecture and design decisions.

## System Architecture

Synstream is built on a microservices architecture with the following key components:

- **Console** — web-based management interface
- **Pipeline Studio** — visual flow designer
- **Execution Engine** — runtime for pipeline execution
- **API Gateway** — RESTful API layer
- **Storage Layer** — persistent data storage

## Design Principles

- **Scalability** — horizontal scaling for high throughput
- **Reliability** — fault tolerance and error recovery
- **Extensibility** — plugin architecture for custom connectors
- **Observability** — comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Next Steps

- Review component-specific architecture documentation
- Explore [Integration Patterns](../integrations/overview)
