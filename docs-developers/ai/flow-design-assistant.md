# Flow Design Assistant

Learn how to use the AI Flow Design Assistant to create workflows faster and more efficiently.

## Overview

The Flow Design Assistant uses AI to help you design workflows by:

- Understanding your requirements
- Suggesting workflow structure
- Recommending node configurations
- Generating workflow templates

## Using the Flow Design Assistant

### Step 1: Describe Your Workflow

Describe what you want your workflow to do:

```
I need a workflow that:
1. Extracts daily sales data from an e-commerce platform
2. Transforms the data to a standard format
3. Loads the data into a data warehouse
4. Sends a notification when complete
```

### Step 2: AI Suggests Workflow Structure

The AI analyzes your requirements and suggests:

- Workflow structure
- Node types and connections
- Configuration settings
- Best practices

### Step 3: Review and Customize

Review the AI suggestions and:

- Customize node configurations
- Adjust workflow structure
- Add additional nodes
- Modify connections

### Step 4: Deploy Workflow

Deploy the workflow:

- Test the workflow
- Review execution results
- Optimize as needed
- Deploy to production

## Example

### Input

```
Create a workflow that processes customer orders:
- Extract orders from a database
- Validate order data
- Calculate order totals
- Send confirmation emails
- Update inventory
```

### AI Suggests

```
Workflow Structure:
1. Start Node (trigger)
2. Database Node (extract orders)
3. Validation Node (validate data)
4. Function Node (calculate totals)
5. Email Node (send confirmation)
6. Database Node (update inventory)
7. Complete Node (finish)
```

### Customize

You can customize:

- Add error handling
- Add logging
- Add retry logic
- Add monitoring

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific** — provide specific requirements for better suggestions
- **Iterate** — iterate on AI suggestions to improve workflows
- **Review** — always review AI suggestions before deploying
- **Test** — test workflows thoroughly before production use
