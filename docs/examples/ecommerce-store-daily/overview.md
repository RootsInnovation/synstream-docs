# Overview

## Background Story

Every day at 3 AM, Nebula Retail's ETL process automatically collects data from three sources:

- **POS.csv** — uploaded by store POS systems from all physical locations
- **online_sales.json** — exported from the e-commerce API
- **inventory.xlsx** — updated by suppliers

The system automatically integrates sales and inventory data, unifies field formats, and uploads everything to the cloud data warehouse. By 6 AM, when the marketing department opens Power BI, they can see the latest omnichannel sales reports with all data consolidated and ready for analysis.

This automated workflow ensures that every morning, decision-makers have access to fresh, unified data from all channels—eliminating the need for manual data collection and processing.

### The Challenge

Many retailers struggle with:

- **Fragmented Data Sources** — data scattered across e-commerce platforms, POS systems, and inventory management systems
- **Manual Data Processing** — time-consuming manual data collection and consolidation processes
- **Inconsistent Data Formats** — different systems using different data structures and formats
- **Delayed Reporting** — lack of real-time visibility into daily sales, inventory, and customer data
- **Data Quality Issues** — errors and inconsistencies in manually processed data
- **Limited Scalability** — processes that don't scale as business grows

### Pain Points

#### Daily Sales Reporting

- **Time-Consuming** — staff spending hours collecting data from multiple systems
- **Error-Prone** — manual data entry leading to mistakes and inconsistencies
- **Delayed Insights** — reports available only after hours of manual work
- **Limited Visibility** — inability to quickly identify trends or issues

#### Inventory Synchronization

- **Disconnected Systems** — inventory data not synchronized between online and physical stores
- **Stock Discrepancies** — inconsistencies between actual inventory and system records
- **Lost Sales** — out-of-stock situations due to poor inventory visibility
- **Overstock Issues** — excess inventory due to lack of real-time data

#### Customer Data Consolidation

- **Duplicate Records** — same customer having multiple records across systems
- **Incomplete Profiles** — missing customer information due to data fragmentation
- **Poor Personalization** — inability to provide personalized experiences without unified customer data
- **Compliance Challenges** — difficulty meeting data privacy requirements with fragmented data

### Business Impact

These challenges lead to:

- **Increased Operational Costs** — manual processes requiring significant time and resources
- **Lost Revenue Opportunities** — inability to respond quickly to market changes
- **Poor Customer Experience** — delayed responses and inconsistent service
- **Decision-Making Delays** — lack of timely data for strategic decisions
- **Competitive Disadvantage** — slower response times compared to competitors
