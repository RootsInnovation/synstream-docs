# E-Commerce Store Daily Data Processing

This example demonstrates how to build a daily data processing pipeline that consolidates data from e-commerce platforms and physical stores.

## Overview

The pipeline processes daily data from multiple sources:
- **E-commerce platform** — online sales data, customer orders, inventory updates
- **Physical stores** — in-store sales, inventory levels, customer transactions
- **Data consolidation** — merge and transform data from different sources
- **Reporting** — generate daily reports and analytics

## Pipeline Flow

1. **Data Extraction** — extract data from e-commerce platforms and store systems
2. **Data Transformation** — clean, validate, and transform data
3. **Data Consolidation** — merge data from different sources
4. **Data Loading** — load processed data into data warehouse or reporting system

## Use Cases
