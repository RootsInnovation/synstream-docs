# Welcome to Synstream Docs

Synstream is an enterprise-grade workflow automation platform built for teams that demand reliability, auditability, and speed. Use Synstream to orchestrate customer journeys, back-office operations, and AI-driven experiences with the same toolset.

What sets Synstream apart:

- **Resilient execution** — advanced retry policies, circuit breakers, and observability keep flows healthy even when downstream systems misbehave.
- **Versioned flow design** — native Git history for every flow lets you branch, review, and roll back with the same rigor as your application code.
- **Connector ecosystem** — integrate dozens of SaaS and on-premises systems out of the box, or bring your own connector framework.
- **AI-first tooling** — built-in assistants can draft flow logic, generate code snippets, and update documentation whether you deploy in the cloud or on-prem.

Explore the sections on the left to learn how to plan, build, and operate flows with Synstream:

- **Getting Started** — essential concepts, environment setup, and first deployment.
- **Guides** — practical tutorials and playbooks for end-to-end use cases.
- **Examples** — real-world examples and templates for common use cases.
- **Troubleshooting** — resolution checklists and diagnostic runbooks.

For technical deep dives into architecture, data models, governance, and release notes, see the [Developers](/developers/intro) section.
